> Effortlessly convert Spotify links to your preferred streaming service

Copy a link from your favorite streaming service, paste it into the app, and voilà! The app instantly provides links to the song or track on all other supported platforms. If the original link is from Spotify, you'll even get a quick audio preview to make sure it's the right track.

## Supported Streaming Services (Adapters)

Adapters represent the streaming services supported by the app, each adapter allows the app to convert links from one platform to other platforms. The table below shows which features are available for each service:

| Adapter | Inverted Search | Official API           | Verified Links |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |

## Local setup

There are a few environment variables you can mock (see `.env.example`). If you would like to contribute, we can always rely on the tests output without needing to run the project. If you'd like to replicate the production environment locally, email me and I’ll provide you with the missing ones.

```sh
docker compose up -d

bun install
bun dev
```
